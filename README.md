# myFlix Client

## Description

myFlix is a single-page, responsive web application built with **React** that allows users to explore information about movies, genres, and directors. Users can create an account, log in, and manage a list of their favorite movies.

This client-side application consumes an existing **REST API** and database created as part of the server-side of the myFlix project. Together, the client and server form a full-stack **MERN** application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## Objective
